Bulk Crafter Macro is a script made specifically for the game Minecraft.

Made using the Python libraries PyAutoGui, PyMsgBox, and PyNput, but the main focus is on PyAutoGui.

The script is a fun project, not at all serious. The idea itself is not mine, but my friend's, Shroombyl (Minecraft name).

The script is still in its early stages and is missing lots of features. This is not a project I will commit to in the meantime, and again, it was made purely for the fun of it.

Check out the releases section for the executable and all features implemented until now.
